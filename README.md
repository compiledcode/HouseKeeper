# HouseKeeper
Python embedded into C++; daily log-reader and report-emailer

- This is a starting point for eventually getting to a 3-way clustered C++/Embedded-Python 
web/application servers with session state replication.  Currenly, the scope is to 
successfully embed Python 3.8 into C++-17

# The jump to the next project will add the following onto this project

- We will need an embedded web server to proxy to from Apache/Nginx
- Sqlite3 for internal log (history) bookkeeping
- gRPC for communication with peers
